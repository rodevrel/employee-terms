# Aim Interactive Employee Terms
### By working with our company, you agree to these terms, as a developer or backend team.
## Harassment Guidelines
### Harassment is not welcome, and if caught can get in big trouble, no matter the type of harassment. This includes outside of the company, like on social media, where you are making an impact on our company, you are a representative.
## External Publishing Guidelines
### Working on your own games or other content is amazing for practice and getting a quick buck, but you do need to go through a process with Aim Interactive if you are an employee (NOT A PARTNER), you must pay small fees monthly and we get full rights to any trademarks such as characters, obviously you can opt out and earn less of a paycheck. This is so employees cannot make competition with us *AT ALL*.
